FindingsEditor
==============

How do you deal with the piles of test results from ultrasounds and endoscopies?
Many medical professionals struggle to manage the considerable paperwork.
I’m writing to introduce a solution – and it costs absolutely nothing. FINDINGS EDITOR.
Many people in your facility can simultaneously use FINDINGS EDITOR, as it automatically grants control write permission to the primary user.
With FINDINGS EDITOR, you will be able to simply, efficiently, accurately and painlessly enter test results from Upper and Lower GI Endoscopies, as well as Abdominal Ultrasounds. (Future releases will include additional tests).
Toho University Ohashi Medical Center has been using a previous version of FINDINGS EDITOR for almost a decade with minimal issues.
